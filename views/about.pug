        h1 About

        p The plan here is to create a simple boilerplate crude app.
        p pug is indentation based and you can span#idname as well as item.class.class2 etc
        p div is assumed, so you can just put .wrapper
        p I will require

            p create

            p read

            p update

            p delete

        h2 To do:
        ul 
            li basic css
            li error handling
            li authentication
            li testing

        //- img(src="C:\dev\berlin\views\ilf.jpg" alt ="Hometown")
        //- img(src="ilf.jpg" alt ="Hometown")
