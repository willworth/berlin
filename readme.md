# Berlin crud app


to start  (windows instructions)
npm install

for mongo to work, it needs you to create
c/data/db
so go to root and create those folders and then
install mongo

go to 
C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin
or wherever mongo is installed and run mongo

then npm start
and the terminal should display that the server is running on a port you can define in app.js




It's just a boilerplate crud app using
*mongo  (database)
*pug (html template rendering)


dotenv for loading env variables!
